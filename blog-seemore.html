            <div class="blog-content">
                <p><span class="size">W</span>e lost our grandpa a year ago, and as we get closer to the anniversary, all these memories of him talking about my wedding “someday”, keep coming back to me. He had a lot of friends. So, we would joke that there would be more of his friends at my wedding than my own. He was also very old-school, so it’s a safe bet that he would have expected all the traditions to be followed and done by the book.</p>  
                <p>While it’s heartbreaking that he cannot be there to watch me walk down the aisle, I started penning a list of ways I could include his memory at my wedding.</p> 
                <p>If you are in the same boat and are looking to honor a lost one—whether you want to do something big, or something subtle, here are a couple ideas I’ve compiled:</p>
                <h5 class="blog-title">In Your Jewellery/Carry a Family Heirloom</h5>
                <p>Was there a signature piece of jewellery that your loved one was known to always wear? Or maybe something they wore at their own wedding?Incorporate this heirloom piece into your wedding day ensemble.</p>
                <p>Whether it was a broach, or a simple necklace that you can remember them wearing, include it on your wedding day, so you’ll feel like they’re right there with you.</p>
                <h5 class="blog-title">In the Food</h5>
                <p>You could do something small and subtle like simply adding their favourite Gulab Jamun to themenu, or, you could go all out and make the entire days theme based on their favourite cuisine.Were they always partial to Italian food? Have live pizza and pasta counters at your reception, <br> followed by rich, decadent Tiramisu for dessert. </p> 
                <p>I saw that my friend did something similar for his wedding, so I talked to him about it. He said:</p>
                <div class="blog-details text-center">
                <p >“Papa was always the life of the party,and a whiskey man through and through.So, for my Sangeet, we had the bartender create a whiskey cocktail because not many people like to drink straight whiskey!”</p>
                <span>— Aryaman, 28</span>      
              </div> 
              <h5 class="blog-title">Reserve a Seat</h5>
              <p>Usually the front few rows are unofficially “reserved” for close relatives. Or in my family, we usually have the parents, and grandparents on the mandap with the ide and groom during the main wedding ceremony or “Muhurtham”.</p> 
                  <p>Leave a seat open, either on the mandap, or in the front row, and place a picture of who you want to honour, or a bouquet of flowers on it.</p> 
                <p>It’ll be nice to look out in the crowd and see their smiling photo where they would have been.</p>  
              <h5 class="blog-title">Make a Donation to Charity</h5>
              <p>In lieu of gifts, have guests directly donate money or essential items to an organisation that your loved one was passionate about. Or have them donate to an organisation you are passionate about in your loved one’s name.</p> 
              <p>There’s also a TON of leftover food after each wedding event. Instead of wasting it, have local organisations and temples that feed the poor or homeless, come and pick it up. However, there might be some restrictions in what food they are allowed to collect. So, don’t forget to consult the <> organisations while you’re planning the menus!</p>
              <h5 class="blog-title">Make a Special Toast</h5>
              <p>If you want to do something more conspicuous, make a quick toast in front of your guests. Say a few words about your loved one—maybe advice they imparted, or how much they meant to you.</p> 
              <p>It can be as simple as saying, <span class="italic">“This song is for___” </span> and play their favourite tune at your sangeet.</p>
              <h5 class="blog-title">Try to Recreate the Past</h5>
              <p>Go through old photos and see if you could recreate how their wedding was. Maybe incorporate the same flowers or wear the same colour saree they wore on their special day.</p>
              <p>It’s tough when someone that means so much to you is not around. Especially on what’s supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life. By including elements that remind you of <> them, it should feel like they are right there by your side.</p>

                        <p><span class="size">H</span>ere’s the thing. Now that the lockdown has been partially lifted, and I’m able to go back to work (with a mask obviously!!!) I have realised just how much damage my mindless quarantine snacking has done to my waistline. Let me tell you, the button on my jeans is about to POP.</p> 
                        <p>So, until the gyms open up again, or until I get sick of dieting (which will be sooner rather than later let’s be honest), I’ve been finding ways to alter recipes to reduce my caloric intake.</p>
                        <p> Instead of binging on chocolates and sweets, I have been incorporating overnight oats to satiate my sweet tooth. Since oats are high in fiber and protein, it provides low-level energy and keeps you feeling full for a longer period of time.</p> 
                        <p>Here’s an overnight oats recipe I created that is low calorie, SO simple, and is deeeelicious.</p> 
                        <p>I’m going to add links to all the ingredients below if you are like me and have been getting your groceries delivered.</p>

                                <p><span class="size">S</span>o you’ve been asked to plan a bachelorette. You, my friend, are officially the bestie the bride trusts the most. While this is exciting, let’s face it, actually putting together this event will fill even the most organised person with dread.</p> 
                                <p>So many things to do, where do you even start? Don’t worry, I’ve created a checklist to break up the process and make this job easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy (I’m already sorry I used this phrase).</p>
                                <h5 class="blog-title">Consult the Bride</h5>
                                <p>Sure, you’ve known the bride since you were both being potty trained, so you know her inside-out. But just to make sure you give her the perfect day, talk to her. Ask her about her likes, dislikes, places she wants to go and people she definitely doesn’t want to invite!!</p>
                                <h5 class="blog-title">Guest-List Checklist</h5>
                                <p>Make a list and start reaching out to them. Unless this is a surprise bachelorette party, run the names by the bride. There’s nothing more awkward than inviting a cousin she doesn’t feel comfortable getting rowdy with or totally forgetting to invite her college roommate!</p> 
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Start a Group Chat</h5>
                              <p>Add all the guests to a WhatsApp group chat (that they can easily mute if you want) or an email thread. This is also a much easier way to delegate tasks and keep track of expenses.</p>  
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Determine a Budget</h5>
                              <p>Who is even paying for this shindig? Usually the friend planning the event has all the guests split the total cost. If this is the case, you need to have that tough talk with the people in the group to estimate how much you all can realistically afford. Talk to them one-on-one so they are more comfortable discussing their financial situation. At the end of the day, we don’t want anyone to get into credit card debt while trying to make sure their bff has an amazing party!</p> 
                              <p>If the bride or her family is paying for it, get the budget right at the start so you can plan the number of guests, venue and theme according to that.</p> 
                              <p>Stick to the budget and avoid asking the family for more. If absolutely necessary, you can get the rest of the guests to chip in.</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Create a Google Doc or Spreadsheet</h5>
                              <p>This way you’ll be able to keep track of all expenses. Share this with the group so they’ll know what they’re paying for and there won’t be any confusion/arguments later!</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Settle on a Date</h5>
                              <p>There are a million and one things the bride has to do and appointments she has to keep before the big day. Make sure the date/dates of the bachelorette party work for her and her friends!!!</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Pick a venue and theme</h5>
                              <p>Are you having it at a friend’s house or are you going to fly to Goa for a whole weekend? What would the bride prefer? It’s so important the event suits the bride’s personality and is something she’ll actually enjoy. Trust me, if your bestie is a homebody, she would much rather have a relaxing weekend getting massages and pedicures at a spa, than bar hop in Phuket till 2am in the morning.</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Make reservations</h5>
                              <p>Once you decide on where you’re going, and what you’re doing, start making reservations and putting down deposits. Especially if this is during peak wedding season time. Set a reminder for a week before the bachelorette party to call and confirm all reservations.</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Create an itinerary</h5>
                              <p>Once you decide on all the fun activities, create an itinerary. This is really only important if you’re having a destination bachelorette party or planning a multi-day shindig.</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">Send out invitations</h5>
                              <p>Whether actual physical cards, or via a group WhatsApp message, mail out complete details/itinerary to the rest of the Bride Tribe.</p>
                              <h5 class="blog-title">HAVE FUN!!</h5>
                              <p>This is supposed to something you can enjoy with your bestie before she bids single life goodbye. So, don’t make this process more taxing than it needs to be. Once all the planning is done, sit back, grab and mimosa, and I cannot stress this enough, have fun!</p>
